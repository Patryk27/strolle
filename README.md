# strolle

Strolle (from _strålspårning_) is a real-time raytracing engine; it contains an
extra integration with Bevy, but can be also used free-standing.

Status: work in progress, no official release yet.

## Examples

``` shell
$ cargo build-shader
$ cargo run --example cube
```

... then use `G` to switch between the rasterized & raytraced view.
