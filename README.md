# strolle

Strolle (from _strålspårning_) is a real-time raytracing engine; it contains an
extra integration with Bevy, but can be also used free-standing.

Status: work in progress, no official release yet.

## Examples

Note that the `cube` example doesn't actually use raytracing just yet -- but the
command is most likely going to be:

``` shell
$ cargo build-shader
$ cargo run --example cube
```
